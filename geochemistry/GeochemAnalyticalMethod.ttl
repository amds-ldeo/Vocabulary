The analyte ions are then accelerated down a beam tube by a positive potential difference of several million volts, passed through an electron stripper to convert them to positive ions, and accelerated back down the beam tube toward common potential where ion velocities approach a few percent of the speed of light. Using a series of magnetic and electrostatic mass filters, the ion beam containing all isotopes of the analyte element is then separated into separate beams containing the (usually unstable) isotope of interest and other isotopes, and each of the isotopes is counted by a separate detector.

  skos:definition "Analytical technique used to measure a wide range of elements in materials such as metals, pottery and glass, based on absorption of light by free metallic ions. The sample is accurately weighed and then dissolved, often using strong acids. The resulting solution is sprayed into the flame of the instrument and atomized. Light of a suitable wavelength for a particular element is shone through the flame, and some of this light is absorbed by the atoms of the sample. Individual elements will absorb wavelengths differently, and these absorbances are measured against standards. The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of the element in the solution, and hence in the original object. Measurements are made separately for each element of interest in turn to achieve a complete analysis of an object, and thus the technique is relatively slow to use. However, it is very sensitive and it can measure trace elements down to the part per million level, as well as being able to measure elements present in minor and major amounts. The method requires standards with known analyte content to establish the relation between the measured absorbance and the analyte concentration.

Although it is a destructive technique (unlike ED-XRF), the sample size needed is very small (typically about 10 milligrams - i.e. one hundredth of a gram) and its removal causes little damage.

  skos:definition "To conduct an atom probe experiment a very sharp needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction into the vacuum system, the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100 K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage is applied to the specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2 kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio. The method is destructive in nature removing ions from a sample surface in order to image and identify them, generating magnifications sufficient to observe individual atoms as they are removed from the sample surface. Through coupling of this magnification method with time of flight mass spectrometry, ions evaporated by application of electric pulses can have their mass-to-charge ratio computed. Through successive evaporation of material, layers of atoms are removed from a specimen, allowing for probing not only of the surface, but also through the material itself.The instrument allows the three-dimensional reconstruction of up to billions of atoms from a sharp tip (corresponding to specimen volumes of 10,000-10,000,000 nm3).

  skos:definition "In CRDS, the beam from a single-frequency laser diode enters a cavity defined by two or more high reflectivity mirrors. When the laser is on, the cavity quickly fills with circulating laser light. A fast photodetector senses the small amount of light leaking through one of the mirrors to produce a signal that is directly proportional to the intensity in the cavity. When the photodetector signal reaches a threshold level (in a few tens of microseconds), the continuous wave (CW) laser is abruptly turned off. The light already within the cavity continues to bounce between the mirrors (about 100,000 times), but because the mirrors have slightly less than 100% reflectivity (99.999%), the light intensity inside the cavity steadily leaks out and decays to zero in an exponential fashion. This decay, or \"ring down\", is measured in real-time by the photodetector, and the amount of time it takes for the ring down to happen is determined solely by the reflectivity of the mirrors (for an empty cavity). When a gas species that absorbs the laser light is introduced into the cavity, a second loss mechanism  (absorption) is introduced, which accelerates the ring down time. Analysis of the ring down time of the cavity with and without absorption due to the target gas species can be used to calculate the concentration of the absorbing substance in the gas mixture in the cavity. Comparison of the ring down time of the cavity with and without any absorbing gas is accomplished by tuning the laser first to a wavelength where the gas absorbs light, and then to a wavelength where the gas does not absorb light."@en ;

The sample solution is injected into the gas chromatography (GC) inlet where it is vaporized and swept onto a chromatographic column by the carrier gas (usually helium). The sample flows through the column and the compounds comprising the mixture of interest are separated by virtue of their relative interaction with the coating of the column (stationary phase) and the carrier gas (mobile phase). Carbon and nitrogen compounds eluting from the chromatographic column then pass through a combustion reactor (an alumina tube containing Cu, Ni and Pt wires maintained at 940 degree C) where they are oxidatively combusted. This is followed by a reduction reactor (an alumina tube containing three Cu wires maintained at 600 degree C) to reduce any nitrogen oxides to nitrogen. For hydrogen and oxygen a high temperature thermal conversion reactor is required. Water is then removed in a water separator by passing the gas stream through a tube constructed from a water permeable nafion membrane.

(Source: IUPAC; https://doi.org/10.1515/pac-2012-0609).   A technique in which the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference is measured as a function of temperature. Both the sample and reference are maintained at nearly the same temperature throughout the experiment. Generally, the temperature program for a DSC analysis is designed such that the sample holder temperature increases linearly as a function of time. The reference sample should have a well-defined heat capacity over the range of temperatures to be scanned. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during phase transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.

This differential temperature is then plotted against time, or against temperature (DTA curve, or thermogram). Changes in the sample, either exothermic or endothermic, can be detected relative to the inert reference. Thus, a DTA curve provides data on the transformations that have occurred, such as glass transitions, crystallization, melting and sublimation. The area under a DTA peak is the enthalpy change and is not affected by the heat capacity of the sample. DTA is similar to differential scanning calorimetry."@en ;

The amount of energy loss can be measured via an electron spectrometer and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss. With some care, and looking at a wide range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam. The scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the dispersion relation of whatever material excitation caused the inelastic scattering. Most common approach today is transmission EELS, in which the incident electrons pass entirely through the material sample. Usually this occurs in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), although some dedicated systems exist which enable extreme resolution in terms of energy and momentum transfer at the expense of spatial resolution.

Some of these electrons will interact with the specimen and result in elastic or inelastic scattering. Inelastic scattering results in both a loss of energy and a change in momentum, which in the case of inner shell ionization, the energy loss is characteristic of the element the electron interacted with. After the electron energy loss spectrum forms in the energy filter, an adjustable energy slit allows only electrons that have not lost energy to pass through to form the image. This is known as zero-loss filtering. The filtering prevents inelastically scattered electrons from contributing to the image plus enhances contrast image and resolution. In addition to zero-loss filtering, you can adjust the system to select electrons that have lost a specific amount of energy to obtain additional contrast effects and compositionally sensitive images.

Light from a polychromatic infrared source is collimated and directed to a beam splitter. Half the light is directed to a fixed mirror and the rest to a moving mirror. The light from the two paths is recombined, resulting in constructive or destructive interference that is a function of wavelength in the polychromatic light source and the path retardation determined by different path lengths from the moving mirror. The recombined light is focused on the sample and reflected or transmitted light is refocused onto a detector.  The difference in optical path length between the two arms to the interferometer is known as the retardation or optical path difference (OPD). An interferogram is obtained by varying the retardation and recording the signal from the detector for various values of the retardation. The interferogram when no sample is present is used as a reference to compare. When a sample is present the background interferogram is modulated by the presence of absorption bands in the sample. The interferogram is converted to a spectrum by Fourier transformation.  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier-transform_infrared_spectroscopy, Skoog, Holler & Crouch p. 188-192)"@en ;

When the input energy wave penetrates the object's surface, is it absorbed and phase shifted. When the input wave reaches areas within the object where the thermophysical properties are not homogeneous in relation to the surrounding material, (i.e. at delaminations or inclusions), the input wave is partially reflected. The reflected portion of the wave interferes with the incoming input wave at the surface of the object, causing an interference pattern in the local surface temperature, which oscillates at the same frequency as the thermal wave. The internal structure of the object being examined can then be derived by evaluating the phase shift of the local surface temperatures in relation to the input energy wave. The ability to derive internal thermophysical inconsistencies within the object, however, requires that the input energy source be used at an optimal frequency, which depends on both the thermophysical characteristics of the object as well as its thickness.

Atomic mass spectrometric analysis involves: (1) atomization, (2) conversion of a substantial fraction of the atoms formed in step 1 to a stream of ions (usually singly charged positive ions), (3) separating the ions formed in step 2 on the basis of their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), where m is the mass number of the ion and z is the number of fundamental charges that it bears, and (4) counting the number of ions of each type or measuring the ion current produced when the ions formed from the sample strike a suitable transducer.

Molecular mass spectrometry is used to determine the structures of inorganic, organic, and biological molecules and the qualitative and quantitative composition of complex mixtures; The appearance of mass spectra for a given molecular species strongly depends on the method used for ion formation.

(Source: IUPAC; https://iupac.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PAC-REC-19-02-03.R2_PR191002MC.pdf). A spectroscopic technique that observes the signal produced by nuclear magnetic resonance of the atomic nuclei in a sample when exposed to excitation by radio waves. The signal is related to local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei. The intramolecular magnetic field around an atom in a molecule changes the resonance frequency, thus giving access to details of the electronic structure of a molecule and its individual functional groups. The electromagnetic waves emitted by the nuclei of the sample as a result of perturbation by a weak oscillating magnetic field are detected with sensitive radio receivers. Upon excitation of the sample with a radio frequency (60--1000 MHz) pulse, a nuclear magnetic resonance response - a free induction decay (FID) - is obtained. It is a very weak signal, and requires sensitive radio receivers to pick up. A Fourier transform is carried out to extract the frequency-domain spectrum from the raw time-domain FID. As the fields are unique or highly characteristic to individual compounds NMR spectroscopy is the definitive method to identify monomolecular organic compounds. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_magnetic_resonance_spectroscopy"@en ;

These two elements turn qPCR to a measurement technique in its own right. The fluorometer detects  fluorescence in real time as the thermal cycler runs, giving readings throughout the amplification process of the PCR.

Raman spectroscopy is commonly used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. This technique uses a source of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation to interact with molecular vibrations, phonons or other excitations in the analyzed sample resulting in the energy of the incident photons being shifted up or down. The light source is typically a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range, although X-rays can also be used.   The shift in energy from the incident source gives information about the vibrational modes in the analyzed sample.  Electromagnetic radiation from the illuminated spot is collected with a lens and sent through a monochromator. Elastic scattered radiation at the wavelength corresponding to the incident excitation is filtered out, while the rest of the collected light is dispersed onto a detector."@en ;

X-ray diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation, collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the incident rays, the orientation of the centered crystal and the detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be attained. Single-crystal diffractometers use either 3- or 4-circle goniometers. These circles refer to the four angles (2*theta, 'chi', 'phi', and 'omega') that define the relationship between the crystal lattice, the incident ray and detector. Samples are mounted on thin glass fibers which are attached to brass pins and mounted onto goniometer heads. Adjustment of the X, Y and Z orthogonal directions allows centering of the crystal within the X-ray beam. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is most commonly used for precise determination of a unit cell, including cell dimensions and positions of atoms within the lattice.

However, because of the orientation dependence of the nuclear spin interactions in the solid state, the majority of high-resolution solid-state NMR spectra are measured under magic-angle spinning (MAS), which has profound effects on the types of radiofrequency pulse sequences required to extract structural and dynamical information.

  skos:definition "(SSMS) a general technique for multielement and isotope trace analyses. In SSMS, the atomic constituents of a sample, housed in a vacuum chamber, are converted by a high-voltage (~30 kV), radio-frequency spark to gaseous ions for mass analysis.  The gaseous positive ions formed in the spark plasma are drawn into the analyzer by a dc voltage. Because a spark source produces ions with a wide range of kinetic energies, double-focusing mass spectrometers are required for mass analysis of the ions. When electron multipliers are used with double-focusing instruments, the spectrum is scanned by varying the magnetic field of the magnetic analyzer. The use of this technique leveled off and then declined with the appearance of ICPMS and some of the other mass spectrometric methods. SSMS is still applied to samples that are not easily dissolved and analyzed by plasma methods.  (Skoog, Holler, & Crouch). Mass spectrometry technique. Components: 1) sample preparation: not specified 2) ionization: spark source. NOTE: spark source systems commonly use double focusing mass analyzers."@en ;

The ionizing radiation flux at the sample site is related to exposure to sunlight (related to depth of burial), cosmic rays, and radiation due to radioactive decay of elements in the enclosing material (mostly related uranium and potassium concentration).  The ionizing radiation in the sample environment creates electronic excited states in the sample that can be trapped. Exposure to light or heat can causes the electrons in these states to decay to a lower-energy state and emit photons. If the sample has been heated at some point (e.g. by firing ceramics), the accumulation of trapped electrons is reset. By measuring the intensity (total energy carried by the photons reaching a unit area) of light emited when the sample is heated, the density of these electronically excited sites can be estimated.

An incident beam impinges upon a polished flat sample carrier at angles below the critical angle of external total reflection for X-rays, resulting in the reflection of most of the excitation beam photons at this surface. Since Total Reflection angle depends on the energy of the photon, one can use this effect to eliminate the high energy photons from the excitation spectrum and minimize their contribution to the background in the measured spectra, thus making possible to achieve better detection limits. Due to this configuration, the measured spectral background in TXRF is less than in conventional XRF. This reduction results in increased signal to noise ratio.

The wavelength of the X-rays reflected into the detector may be varied by changing the position of the analyzing crystal relative to the sample i.e. the X-ray source-crystal distance is a linear function of the wavelength. Consequently, X-rays from only one element at a time can be measured on the spectrometer and the position of a given analytical crystal must be changed in order to adjust to a wavelength characteristic of another element. There is commonly more than a single analytical crystal in a WD spectrometer and, in the case of most EPMA instruments, there are typically multiple spectrometers with a suite of analytical crystals so that the spectrometers can reach all of the elemental wavelengths of interest and it will optimize performance in different wavelength ranges. X-rays of specific wavelengths from the analytical crystal are passed on to the X-ray detector. (https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/wds.html)"@en ;

  skos:definition "This technique is based on the absorption of an X-ray photon, in which an electron interacts with an incident X-ray to acquire a time dependent acceleration. The electron may then be promoted from a core-orbital to an unoccupied bound or continuum state with an intensity given by Fermi's Golden Rule. By varying the energy of a monochromatized beam of incident photons, a spectrum of the absorption cross section can be generated. The probability of an excitation sharply increases when the energy of the incident photon reaches the binding energy of a core-electron. In X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) this is referred to as an edge. XANES is a subset of XAS in which the local electronic structure is characterized by investigating the absorption cross section within 50-100 eV of an edge. The XANES region is sensitive to a wealth of electronic structure information, which may be analyzed in three sections. Before the edge, the intensity of pre-edge features is greatly affected by the coordination geometry of the central atom. At the edge, formal oxidation state may be qualitatively assigned, as the energy of the edge position is not an invariant quantity for a given element, the position shifts in accordance with electron density. Finally, coordination shells are interrogated just beyond the edge as the emitted photoelectron scatters off neighboring atoms.

When the incident X-ray energy is larger than the electron binding energy, there is a sharp increase in absorption (an edge). The edge positions are related to the core electron that is excited. Each element has its own edge energy, and an element's valence can be measured even in a heterogeneous sample. There are three main regions found on a spectrum generated by XAS data which are treated as separate spectroscopic techniques: 1) absorption threshold determined by the transition to the lowest unoccupied states; 2) near-edge structure (XANES); 3) Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) (at energy higher than the edge). X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is used for determining the local geometric and/or electronic structure of matter. The experiment is usually performed at synchrotron radiation facilities, which provide intense and tunable X-ray beams. Samples can be in the gas phase, solutions, or solids.

X-ray diffraction is based on constructive interference of monochromatic X-rays and a crystalline sample. These X-rays are generated by a cathode ray tube, filtered to produce monochromatic radiation, collimated to concentrate, and directed toward the sample. The interaction of the incident rays with the sample produces constructive interference (and a diffracted ray) when conditions satisfy Bragg's Law (n*'lambda'=2d*sin(theta)). This law relates the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to the diffraction angle and the lattice spacing in a crystalline sample. These diffracted X-rays are then detected, processed and counted. By changing the geometry of the incident rays, the sample, and the detector, all possible diffraction directions of the lattice should be attained.(https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/geochemsheets/techniques/XRD.html) Copper K-a radiation (l = 0.15406 nm, E = 8.04 keV) is typically used for routine XRD.
